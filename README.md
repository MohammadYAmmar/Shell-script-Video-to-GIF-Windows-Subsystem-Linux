Repo name: Shell script Video to GIF Windows Subsystem Linux 
Description: It's a tool to convert video to GIF high quality that I'll use every day. I program a shell script with a click via Java using the Linux subsystem in Windows.

# What is it?
This utility program is helpful when you need to run any shell script in Windows if already installed subsystem Linux.
The attached example for converting any video into an animated image (GIF) via the (FFmpeg) tool in Linux.

# How to use it?
Simply, run the java program and put a script in the same folder, and Video if use the attached example to convert to GIF.
Hope it helps you.

# What are the requirements?
Depends on where you will be running it, if on Windows you will need Java to run in addition to Linux as a subsystem.
1 - Link in Microsoft Store and can select your favorite Linux distribution:
https://aka.ms/wslstore

2 - Depends on the system you will be running it on, if you need to run Windows you will need Java as well as Linux as a subsystem.
Linux is enough just shell script.

# Introduction:
I learned a course in YouTube how to write a shell script and I liked how it can facilitate many operations in Linux, so I liked to take advantage of it in my platform, which is currently Windows 10, so I decided to facilitate a more practical process that I implement when describing a repository in GitHub, which is to convert the video into an animation, then instead of Entering the Linux terminal every time to run the shell, I decided to make a Java program whose purpose is to be an intermediary to run the shell script in two clicks and as quickly as possible. I will not need to open programs for conversion and sites that convert online anymore!

# Implementation:
I am using IDE is intelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2021.2 to java project and bulid JAR files. 

This is the project structure that explains the tool sequence, I designed it with (draw.io Diagrams)

# Future work
- Convert JAR to EXE
- Test in different devices and add more options if something is not found.
- Result of testing
- Merge two files in one
- Release file of project after version 1 finish
